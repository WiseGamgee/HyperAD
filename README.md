# HyperAD

HyperAD is a Python project that implements various RX-based real-time anomaly detection 
algorithms designed for hyperspectral line-scan cameras. It also proposes the Exponentially moving RX
algorithm (ERX) for this task (open access article available in IEEE TGRS [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10847782)). An example of ERX detecting live wildfires is shown below:

## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Line-scan cameras capture one line of pixels at a time, and require the motion of an attached platform 
such as a drone, aircraft, or satellite to collect an image. They are an affordable way of collecting
hyperspectral images with high spectral and spatial resolutions.

 <em>A line-scan camera capturing one line of pixels at a time as itâ€™s platform (e.g., a drone) moves 
     over the area of interest. These lines form a hyperspectral image, or datacube, with the depth dimension 
     b representing the spectral bands for each pixel (Garske et al. 2025).</em>

## Quickstart <a name="quickstart"></a>

1. Install python (this project was built on Python 3.9) and clone this repository.

2. Install requirements (ideally in a virtual environment):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. The quickstart example script contains a simple implementation of ERX
with a for loop. To run this script use:
```
python3 0_quickstart_example.py
```
4. A real-time example script is also available to visualise how ERX could run in practice. 
To run this script use the code below. Note that by default a generated dataset is used, but a filepath
to one of the other datasets can also be used (or a custom np.array dataset with shape n_pixels, n_lines, 
n_bands):
```
python3 1_real_time_example.py
```


## Datasets <a name="datasets"></a>
Three annotated datasets are openly available [here](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13370799) in .npy format (height, width, channels for image files, and height, width for masks):
### Beach dataset - a natural coastal area with a variety of human-made anomalies present :car:

![Beach Ground Truth](images/beach_gt.png)
### Synthetic dataset - a constructed dataset using pixels sampled from AVIRIS with anomalous targets :dart:

### Sequoia National Park dataset - a national park with live wildfires present :fire: This image is Sentinel-2 data extracted using sentinelhub.

## Paper Experiments <a name="experiments"></a>
The experiments simulate a line-scan camera by feeding each image dataset one line of pixels at a time 
to each detection algorithm. The simulation consists of two objects:
 - A sampler, which is used to store a hyperspectral image dataset and feed it line-by-line to the detector
 - A detector, which is the anomaly detection algorithm that processes each line.

The simulator and it's classes are contained in /utils/simulation_core.py, 
and the detection algorithms are in /detectors.

Four experiments are contained in their own folders:
 1) test_speed - Tests the speed of the algorithms over increasing band/channel numbers.
 2) test_detection - Gets AUC of the algorithms for a given dataset.
 3) test_projection - An ablation study of sparse random projection.
 4) test_momentum - An ablation study of the exponentially moving mean and covariance.
ERX is evaluated for different momentum values, and when the component is removed.
 5) [TBC] threshold_gridsearch - finds optimal thresholds for each dataset. Still being updated.

You can run the speed test right away as it uses generated data. First navigate to the speed test
directory:
```
cd test_speed
```
Then run the test and visualise the results:
```
python3 run_speed_test.py
python3 show_speed_results.py
```
If you run into problems in the experiments with the detectors, try this before rerunning the previous 
step again:
```
export PYTHONPATH=..
```
For the other experiments download the datasets from [here](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13370799) and put them in a \data folder. Repeat step three for the other experimental directories, and make sure you update and check the configuration file for each experiment for where the data is stored.

Please feel free to raise any issues with this guide or the code in general.
